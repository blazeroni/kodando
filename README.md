# kodando libraries

Kotlin JS bindings and libraries.

## About the name

It's common in programming to use "coding" to refer to the action of programming, 
that is, the action of generating code by hand. If you change the 'c' with 'k', the
sound will be the same (see koding), but now we have a reference to the kotlin language. 
Bad or not, that's a common practice by the community that generate kotlin libraries like:

* https://github.com/mplatvoet/kovenant;
* Kotlin/ktor;
* TinyMission/kara;
* kohesive/kovert;
  
So, why 'kodando' and not 'coding'? That's why I'm brazilian and here, in Brazil, the 'ing' at
the end of words can be translated directly like 'ando', so some guys will say 'Estou codando!',
that is, 'I'm coding!'. The rest of the history is the same, 'c' to 'k' and we have 'kodando'.

Ok, maybe I had should thinking a little more, but...


## About the libraries

I have built some bindings and libraries to allow kotlin developers to code in kotlin but to use,
if they want, existing and good libraries in JS.

Every library will be published in https://bintray.com/danfma/maven, so you will be able to use
it with Maven, Gradle or other.

Right now, we have:

* **kodando-es6** - ES6 libraries and utilities;
* **kodando-rxjs** - Support to the Rxjs library;
* **kodando-jest** - Support to the Jest library;

More will be published. Almost all of these libraries are incomplete, but some are already useful 
and you are welcome to **contribute** to them and put what you need! So, let's make a huge
collection of JS libraries to kotlin here.
