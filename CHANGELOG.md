# CHANGELOG

## 0.1.9

### kodando-react@15.4.3-v10

- [BREAKING CHANGES] - To many breaking changes to a single line:
    - Lifecycle interfaces moved to package `kodando.react.lifecycle`;
    - **If you are using `React.createElement` this will affect you**! Relaxed `React.createElement` definitions to a single generic definition. But
    all the safe functions continue to exist but out of the module as simple functions,
    named: `createElement`;
    - ReactProps now is an abstract class which holds a JSON (the real props) to be 
    passed to React;
    - Normalization of props. Now a single element isnÂ´t anymore an array with one element.
    This would allow to use `react-router` and other libraries that check for this. 

### kodando-react-dom@15.4.3-v10

- [BREAKING CHANGES] - Changes in types to reflect the new `kodando-react` changes.

### kodando-react-router@4.0.0-v5

- [BREAKING CHANGES] - Changes in types to reflect the new `kodando-react` changes.
- [FIX] - Now the routers are working as demanded.

### kodando-mobx-react@4.1.5-v6

- [BREAKING CHANGES] - Changes in types to reflect the new `kodando-react` changes.

## 0.1.7

### BREAKING CHANGES

* Renamed the function `<T> objectOf(): T` to `<T> objectWithShapeOf(setter: PropSetter<T>): T`;
* Renamed the function `<T> objectOf(setter: PropSetter<T>): T` to `<T> objectWithShapeBy(setter: PropSetter<T>): T`;
* Renamed the function `<T> emptyPropsOf(): T` to `<T> unsafePropsOf(): T`;
* Renamed the function `<T> emptyPropsOf(setter: PropSetter<T>): T` to `<T> emptyPropsBy(setter: PropSetter<T>): T`;
* Renamed type `EmptyProps` to `BaseProps` and make it an open class;

### NEW

* Added a two functions to work with props:
  * `fun <T : ReactProps> propsBy(factory: () -> T, setter: PropSetter<T>): T` - which will receive a factory and a props setter;
  * `fun <T : ReactProps> propSetterOf(factory: KFunction<T>): (PropSetter<T>) -> T` - which will return a props setter function from a props factory function;

## 0.1.1

### BREAKING CHANGES

* [EXPERIMENT] First try to create a standard to publish the libraries:
    * Trying to publish the libraries in Npm and into the Jar at bintray.
      This would allow to anyone who aims to consume the library by npm (using webpack for example),
      or by another workflow.
    * I'm not satisfied with the current workflow but it probably will work for
      most of the people. I think we need some better tools, some kind of
      plugins to gradle or maven.
